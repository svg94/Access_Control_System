# Access_Control_System
These are my code snippets for my university project where I build an access control system with a RaspberryPi and a RFID-RC522 with a Mifare Classic Card.

**caution**
The MIFARE Classic Card is not secure. Its crypto has been cracked in 2008. This is just for university and fun purposes. If you want to recreate such a system, I recommend using a DESFire Ev1 (or newer) Card because those are safer.

The mfrc522 library i have used is from @pimylifeup
